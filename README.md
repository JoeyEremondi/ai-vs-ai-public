This project is a combination of a working web application and a tutorial.
The inline comments should guide you through an understanding of how this
application works.

I recommend reading the modules in the following order:

* Foundation
* Import
* Handler.Home
* Handler.Fib
* Handler.Markdown
* Main

This application provides both a JSON API for two simple services (markdown processing
and fibonacci number calculation), as well as a simplistic web frontend for accessing
those services.

Feel free to set the Main module as the target and run this application immediately to
see what the result is. Then come back, read the code, experiment with some changes,
and rerun the application. If at any point you want to undo your changes, use the "Git"
top menu and select "Reset".
